   abstract = {The contamination of groundwater by arsenic in Bangladesh is the largest poisoning of a population in history, with millions of people exposed. This paper describes the history of the discovery of arsenic in drinking-water in Bangladesh and recommends intervention strategies. Tube-wells were installed to provide ''pure water'' to prevent morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal disease. The water from the millions of tube-wells that were installed was not tested for arsenic contamination. Studies in other countries where the population has had long-term exposure to arsenic in groundwater indicate that 1 in 10 people who drink water containing 500 mg of arsenic per litre may ultimately die from cancers caused by arsenic, including lung, bladder and skin cancers. The rapid allocation of funding and prompt expansion of current interventions to address this contamination should be facilitated. The fundamental intervention is the identification and provision of arsenic-free drinking water. Arsenic is rapidly excreted in urine, and for early or mild cases, no specific treatment is required. Community education and participation are essential to ensure that interventions are successful; these should be coupled with follow-up monitoring to confirm that exposure has ended. Taken together with the discovery of arsenic in groundwater in other countries, the experience in Bangladesh shows that groundwater sources throughout the world that are used for drinking-water should be tested for arsenic.},

   abstract = {Since 1996, 52,202 water samples from hand tubewells were analyzed for arsenic (As) by flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-HG-AAS) from all 64 districts of Bangladesh; 27.2\% and 42.1\% of the tubewells had As above 50 and 10 μg/l, respectively; 7.5\% contained As above 300 μg/l, the concentration predicting overt arsenical skin lesions. The groundwater of 50 districts contained As above the Bangladesh standard for As in drinking water (50 μg/l), and 59 districts had As above the WHO guideline value (10 μg/l). Water analyses from the four principal geomorphological regions of Bangladesh showed that hand tubewells of the Tableland and Hill tract regions are primarily free from As contamination, while the Flood plain and Deltaic region, including the Coastal region, are highly As-contaminated. Arsenic concentration was usually observed to decrease with increasing tubewell depth; however, 16\% of tubewells deeper than 100 m, which is often considered to be a safe depth, contained As above 50 μg/l. In tubewells deeper than 350 m, As >50 μg/l has not been found. The estimated number of tubewells in 50 As-affected districts was 4.3 million. Based on the analysis of 52,202 hand tubewell water samples during the last 14 years, we estimate that around 36 million and 22 million people could be drinking As-contaminated water above 10 and 50 μg/l, respectively. However for roughly the last 5 years due to mitigation efforts by the government, non-governmental organizations and international aid agencies, many individuals living in these contaminated areas have been drinking As-safe water. From 50 contaminated districts with tubewell As concentrations >50 μg/l, 52\% of sampled hand tubewells contained As <10 μg/l, and these tubewells could be utilized immediately as a source of safe water in these affected regions provided regular monitoring for temporal variation in As concentration. Even in the As-affected Flood plain, sampled tubewells from 22 thanas in 4 districts were almost entirely As-safe. In Bangladesh and West Bengal, India the crisis is not having too little water to satisfy our needs, it is the challenge of managing available water resources. The development of community-specific safe water sources coupled with local participation and education are required to slow the current effects of widespread As poisoning and to prevent this disaster from continuing to plague individuals in the future. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Arsenic contamination of groundwater resources threatens the health of millions of people worldwide, particularly in the densely populated river deltas of Southeast Asia. Although many arsenic-affected areas have been identified in recent years, a systematic evaluation of vulnerable areas remains to be carried out. Here we present maps pinpointing areas at risk of groundwater arsenic concentrations exceeding 10gl1. These maps were produced by combining geological and surface soil parameters in a logistic regression model, calibrated with 1,756 aggregated and geo-referenced groundwater data points from the Bengal, Red River and Mekong deltas. We show that Holocene deltaic and organic-rich surface sediments are key indicators for arsenic risk areas and that the combination of surface parameters is a successful approach to predict groundwater arsenic contamination. Predictions are in good agreement with the known spatial distribution of arsenic contamination, and further indicate elevated risks in Sumatra and Myanmar, where no groundwater studies exist. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

   abstract = {Chronic exposure to groundwater contaminated with geogenic arsenic (As) poses a significant threat to human health worldwide, especially for those living on floodplains in South and Southeast (S–SE) Asia. In the alluvial and deltaic aquifers of S–SE Asia, aqueous As concentrations vary sharply over small spatial scales (10–100 m), making it challenging to identify where As contamination is present and mitigate exposure. Improved mechanistic understanding of the factors that control groundwater As levels is essential to develop models that accurately predict spatially variable groundwater As concentrations. Here we demonstrate that surface flooding duration and interannual frequency are master variables that integrate key hydrologic and biogeochemical processes that affect groundwater As levels in S–SE Asia. A machine-learning model based on high-resolution, satellite-derived, long-term measures of surface flooding duration and frequency effectively predicts heterogeneous groundwater As concentrations at fine spatial scales in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. Our approach can be reliably applied to identify locations of safe and unsafe groundwater sources with sufficient accuracy for making management decisions by solely using remotely sensed information. This work is important to evaluate levels of As exposure, impacts to public health, and to shed light on the underlying hydrogeochemical processes that drive As mobilization into groundwater.},

   abstract = {For more than a decade it has been known that shallow tube wells in Bangladesh are frequently contaminated with arsenic concentrations at a level that is harmful to human health. By now it is clear that a disaster of an unheard magnitude is going on: the World Health Organization has estimated that long-term exposure to arsenic in groundwater, at concentrations over 500 µg L −1 , causes death in 1 in 10 adults. Other studies show that problems with arsenic in groundwater/drinking water occur in many more countries worldwide , such as in the USA and China. In Europe the focus on arsenic problems is currently confined to countries with high arsenic levels in their groundwater, such as Serbia, Hungary and Italy. In most other European countries, the naturally occurring arsenic concentrations are mostly lower than the European drinking water standard of 10 µg L −1. However, from the literature review presented in this paper, it is concluded that at this level health risks cannot be excluded. As consumers in European countries expect the drinking water to be of impeccable quality, it is recommended that water supply companies optimize arsenic removal to a level of <1 µg L −1 , which is technically feasible.},

   abstract = {While Bangladesh made significant achievements in safe water coverage via installation of shallow tubewells (STWs) nationwide, this success was shattered by the discovery of arsenic (As) in the STWs. The extent and severity of As groundwater contamination throughout Bangladesh and its detrimental effects on human health are well known and demand long-term sustainable mitigation. It is an immensely complex and expensive task to bring tens of millions of arsenic exposed people under safe water coverage. While various mitigation measures have been undertaken by various organizations, most have not achieved their expected outcomes due to technical, spatial and socio-economic challenges. Better understanding of these challenges by institutional stakeholders is crucial for sustainable arsenic mitigation in Bangladesh. In this study, institutional stakeholders' opinions on various aspects of As mitigation were elicited to identify their preferences for and reservations of specific mitigation measures. The current status of As mitigation activities and the factors influencing the success of As mitigation were also explored. Institutional weakness, lack of accountability and a latency period were the major factors hindering sustainable As mitigation. The results also suggested that the stakeholders' understanding of the As problem and their preferences for the different mitigation measures have a significant impact on the effectiveness of As mitigation. Mitigation of As contamination is a complex issue that requires a coordinated effort from various levels of stakeholders. The concept of "paying for water", which is currently potentially unknown in the rural areas of Bangladesh, also needs to be developed as this will create a stronger sense of user ownership of As safe water and thus better water management. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Groundwater through hand-operated tubewell (a type of water well) tapping is the main source of drinking water in Bangladesh. This study investigated iron and manganese concentration in groundwater across Jashore district–one of the worst arsenic contaminated area in Bangladesh. One working tubewell that had been tested previously for arsenic and marked safe (green) was selected from each unions of the district. Results revealed that approximately 73\% and 87\% of groundwater samples exceeded the limits for iron and manganese in Bangladesh drinking water, respectively. Additionally, spatial distribution of iron and manganese indicate that only 5\% of the total surface area of groundwater is covered by safe level of iron and manganese. Human health risk due to ingestion of iron and manganese through drinking water was evaluated using hazard quotients (HQ) for adults and children. The result of the health risk assessment revealed that the non-carcinogenic health risks due to ingestion of iron (HQ up to 1.446 for adults and 0.590 for children) and manganese (HQ up to 2.459 for adults and 1.004 for children) contaminated groundwater are much higher among adults than children. On the basis of occurrences, spatial distribution and health risk assessment results, the area can be categorized as a high-risk zone for iron and manganese-related problems and needs special attention in order to protect public health of local residents.},

   abstract = {Big Data Analytics and Deep Learning are two high-focus of data science. Big Data has become important as many organizations both public and private have been collecting massive amounts of domain-specific information, which can contain useful information about problems such as national intelligence, cyber security, fraud detection, marketing, and medical informatics. Companies such as Google and Microsoft are analyzing large volumes of data for business analysis and decisions, impacting existing and future technology. Deep Learning algorithms extract high-level, complex abstractions as data representations through a hierarchical learning process. Complex abstractions are learnt at a given level based on relatively simpler abstractions formulated in the preceding level in the hierarchy. A key benefit of Deep Learning is the analysis and learning of massive amounts of unsupervised data, making it a valuable tool for Big Data Analytics where raw data is largely unlabeled and un-categorized. In the present study, we explore how Deep Learning can be utilized for addressing some important problems in Big Data Analytics, including extracting complex patterns from massive volumes of data, semantic indexing, data tagging, fast information retrieval, and simplifying discriminative tasks. We also investigate some aspects of Deep Learning research that need further exploration to incorporate specific challenges introduced by Big Data Analytics, including streaming data, high-dimensional data, scalability of models, and distributed computing. We conclude by presenting insights into relevant future works by posing some questions, including defining data sampling criteria, domain adaptation modeling, defining criteria for obtaining useful data abstractions, improving semantic indexing, semi-supervised learning, and active learning.},

   abstract = {Arsenic (As)contamination of groundwater is a public health concern, impacting the lives of approximately 100 million people in India. Chronic exposure to As significantly increases mortality due to the occurrence of several types of cancer, respiratory and cardiac diseases. Uttar Pradesh is a part of the middle Indo-Gangetic plains and has been found to be severely affected by As contamination of groundwater, as established by several small-scale studies. The current study incorporates a hybrid method based on a random forest ensemble algorithm and univariate feature selection using 1473 data points for predicting As in the region. Twenty direct/proxy predictor variables were considered to describe the geochemical environment, aquifer conditions and topography that are responsible for As enrichment in groundwater. The map of As predicted through the hybrid random forest ensemble model shows an overall accuracy of 84.67\%. The hybrid random forest model performs better than the univariate, logistic, fuzzy, adaptive fuzzy and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems, which have been widely used for As prediction. The projected number of rural populations at risk due to high As exposure is 12\% of the total population of the region, which accounts for 23.48 million people who are at risk. The predictive map provides insight for the regions where future testing campaigns and interventions for mitigation should be prioritized by policymakers.},

This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness, sometimes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},
