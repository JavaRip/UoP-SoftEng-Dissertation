%%%% In the final submission of a thesis, this should only be the year

%%%% they don't get mixed up.
    
\date{2023}

%% It is useful to split the document up as chapters and include
%% them.  LaTeX will sort out all the numbering and cross-referencing

\begin{abstract}
  The drinking problem referred to in the title is groundwater arsenic pollution. This project aims to evaluate existing expert system predictive models developed in the University of Portsmouth and compare them to machine learning based models.

  In 2023 machine learning and artificial intelligence are becoming ever more prevalent, this dissertation explores the potential impact this field could have on predicting the arsenic pollution of groundwater.
